1. Introduction

 For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding
 used has been US-ASCII [ASCII]. This was a sensible choice at the
 time: the language of the Series is English, a language which only
 uses US-ASCII-encoded characters (ignoring for a moment words
 borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets). US-ASCII is the
 "lowest common denominator" for character encoding, making cross-
 platform viewing trivial.

 There are limits to US-ASCII, however, which hinder its continued use
 as the exclusive character encoding for the Series. The increasing
 need for easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is
 time to allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary. Given
 the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms, the use
 of non-ASCII should not be gratuitous in a document. This RFC
 describes the rules under which non-ASCII characters may be used in
 an RFC. These rules will be applied as the necessary changes are
 made to submission checking and editorial tools.

2. Basic requirements

 Three fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples
 provided in this document. They are:




Flanagan Expires August 18, 2014 [Page 2]
 Internet-Draft Non-ASCII RFCs February 2014


 o Searches of an index need to be able to find multiple ways of
 writing an author's name;

 o People whose system does not have the fonts needed to display a
 particular RFC need to be able to read the non-canonical HTML,
 text, or PDF RFC correctly.

3. Rules for the use of non-ASCII characters

3.1. General usage throughout a document

 The mention, as opposed to the use, of non-ASCII characters requires
 the use of Unicode identifiers. Including non-ASCII characters in
 the text is encouraged to make the mention clearer to readers with
 devices that can render the non-ASCII text. Including Unicode
 character names is allowed.

 The distinction is between an occasion in which a word appears in a
 sentence in order to convey the meaning of that word (use), and an
 occasion in which a word appears in order to make some point about
 that word itself (mention).

 Spelling for words commonly used in the English language will follow
 the guidance in the Mirriam-Webster dictionary. Other uses,
 including archaic or untraditional spellings, are not allowed.

 Example:

 Use:

SIP/2.0 200 = 2**3 * 5**2 но сто девяносто девять - простое
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.0.2.198;branch=z9hG4bK1324923
Call-ID: unreason.1234ksdfak3j2erwedfsASdf
CSeq: 35 INVITE
From: sip:user@example.com;tag=11141343
To: sip:user@example.edu;tag=2229
Content-Length: 154
Content-Type: application/sdp

 Mention:

For example, the characters "ᏚᎢᎵᎬᎢᎬᏒ" (U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2
U+13AC U+13D2) from the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII
characters "STPETER" as they might look when presented using a "creative"
font family.

3.2. Author Names



Flanagan Expires August 18, 2014 [Page 3]
 Internet-Draft Non-ASCII RFCs February 2014


 Valid Unicode is required, and for non-ASCII names, an ASCII-only
 identifier is required.

3.3. Body of the document

 Non-ASCII characters may be used only where necessary to clearly
 express the intended meaning of the text. When such characters are
 mentioned in the text, the following rules apply:

 o Non-ASCII characters will require identifying the codepoint (e.g.
 U+0394)

 o Use of the actual UTF-8 character (e.g., &#916;) is encouraged so
 that a reader can more easily see what the character is, if their
 device can render the text.

 o If preferred by the author(s), the use of the official character
 names like "Greek Capital Letter Delta" is allowed.

 Internet-Draft Non-ASCII RFCs February 2014


Examples:

OLD (draft-ietf-precis-framework):
However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full range of
Unicode code points into protocol strings. For example, the characters
U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from the Cherokee block
look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when
presented using a "creative" font family.

NEW/ALLOWED:
However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full range of
Unicode code points into protocol strings. For example, the characters
U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 (ᏚᎢᎵᎬᎢᎬᏒ) from the
Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they
might look when presented using a "creative" font family.

ALSO ACCEPTABLE:
However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full range of
Unicode code points into protocol strings. For example, the characters
"ᏚᎢᎵᎬᎢᎬᏒ" (U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2) from the
Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they
might look when presented using a "creative" font family.

3.4. Tables

 Tables follow the same rules for identifiers and characters as the
 body. If it is sensible (i.e., more understandable for a reader) for
 a given document to have two tables, one including the identifiers
 and characters, one with just the characters, that will be allowed on
 a case by case basis.

 Example: TBD

3.5. Code components

 Use the U+ notation except within a code component where you must
 follow the rules of the programming language in which you are writing
 the code

 Example:

 TBD

3.6. Bibliographic text

 The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are
 present must be available in ASCII. As long as good sense is used,
 they may also include non-ASCII characters at author discretion.
 This applies to both normative and informative references.

Example:
[GOST3410] "Information technology. Cryptographic data
 security. Signature and verification processes of [electronic]
 digital signature.", GOST R 34.10-2001, Gosudarstvennyi Standard of
 Russian Federation, Government Committee of Russia for Standards,
 2001. (In Russian)

Allowable addition to the above citation:
 "Информационная технология. Криптографическая защита
 информации. Процессы формирования и проверки
 электронной цифровой подписи ", GOST R 34.10-2001,
 Государственный стандарт Российской Федерации, 2001.

3.7. Keywords

 Keywords must be US-ASCII only.

4. Normalization Forms

 If the normalization matters to the content, the authors must submit
 in a normalization-resistant form. In other words, authors should
 not expect normalization forms to be preserved.

5. IANA Considerations

 This document makes no request of IANA.

 Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
 RFC.

6. Internationalization Considerations

 TBD

7. Security Considerations

8. Acknowledgements

 With many thanks to the members of the IAB i18n program.
