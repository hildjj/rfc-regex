RFC Format BoF
Wednesday, 6 March 2014 @ 15:20-16:20

Agenda
•  Background
•  The RFC Format Design Team •  The I-Ds
•  Non-ASCII in RFCs
•  Next Steps
•  Q&A

Background
The format announcement in May 2013 indicated several things:
–  the canonical format we are exploring for RFCs is XML
–  four publicaTon formats will be created from that XML: HTML, EPUB, text and PDF
–  non-ASCII characters would be allowed in a
controlled fashion

RFC Format Design Team
•  An RFC format design team was put together during IETF 87 in Berlin to clear up the details implied by those statements

Many thanks to Nevil Brownlee (ISE), Tony Hansen, Joe Hildebrand, Paul Hoffman, Ted Lemon, Julian Reschke, Adam Roach, Alice Russo, Robert Sparks (Tools Team liaison), and Dave Thaler for their parIcipaIon

Non-ASCII in RFCs
Note that the tools used to post I-Ds and create RFCs are not ready to allow this new guidance

Requirements
•  Searches of an index need to be able to find mulTple ways of wriTng an author's name;
•  People whose system do not have the fonts needed to display a parTcular RFC need to be able to read the non-canonical HTML, text, or PDF RFC correctly.

Note on language
•  The language of the RFC Series is English. The use of non-ASCII characters is expected to be more the excepTon within the body of the text than the rule.

Person Names
Non-ASCII characters in names are allowed, but in this case an addiTonal ASCII-only variant is required.

Body Text
Where required for implementaTon and understanding of content:
•  Require idenTfying the codepoint (e.g. U+0394)
•  Encourage using the actual character (e.g., Δ) so reader can more easily see what the character is, if they can render it (U+ form etc isn't human intelligible per se)
•  Allow official character names like "Greek Capital LeYer Delta”

Body Text – example
(color and boldface highlight examples – their use is not part of the proposal for non-ASCII text)
•  CURRENT (drac-ieb-precis-framework) :
However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings. For example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when presented using a
   "creative" font family.
•  PROPOSED/NEW:

For example, the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U +13AC U+13D2 (ᏚᎢᎵᎬᎢᎬᏒ) from the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when presented using a "creative" font family.!
•  ALSO ACCEPTABLE:
However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full range of Unicode code points into protocol strings. For example, the characters "ᏚᎢᎵᎬᎢᎬᏒ" (U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2) from the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might look when presented using a "creative" font family.!

Body Text – example
(color and boldface highlight examples – their use is not part of the proposal for non-ASCII text)
•  Current (RFC 6912)
•  The IAB recommendations do, however, leave some issues open that need to be addressed. It is not clear that all code points permitted under IDNA2008 that have a General_Category of Lo or Lm are appropriate for a zone such as the root zone. To take but one example, the code point U+02BC (MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) has a General_Category of Lm. In practically every rendering (and we are unaware of an exception), U+02BC is indistinguishable from U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), which has a General_Category of Pf (Final_Punctuation). U+02BC will also be read by large numbers of people as being the same character as U+0027 (APOSTROPHE), which has a General_Category of Po (Other_Punctuation), and some computer systems may treat U+02BC as U+0027. U+02BC is PROTOCOL VALID (PVALID) under IDNA2008 (see the IDNA Code Points document [RFC5892]), whereas both other code points are DISALLOWED. So, to begin with, it is plain that not every code point with a General_Category of Ll, Lo, or Lm is consistent with the type of conservatism principle discussed in Section 4.1 below or the previous IAB recommendations.!

The “use” versus “menTon” case
•  ThemenTon,asopposedtotheuse,ofnon-ASCII characters requires Unicode idenTfiers, encourages the use of the non-ASCII characters, and allows the use Unicode character names.
•  ThedisTncTonisbetweenanoccasioninwhichaword appears in a sentence in order to convey the meaning of that word (use), and an occasion in which a word appears in order to make some point about that word itself (menTon).
•  SpellingwillfollowtheguidanceintheMerriam-Webster dicTonary. Other uses, including preference for spelling (like the _New Yorker_ stylesheet coöperate and so on) are not allowed.

Non-ASCII Characters in Artworks
•  In artwork, non-ASCII characters (such as box- drawing characters) cannot be used for creaTng structure, but they are allowed in examples of non-ASCII text.
•  AddiTonal guidance TBD

Bibliographic Text
The reference entry must be in English; whatever subfields are present MUST be available in ASCII. As long as good sense is used, they MAY also include non-ASCII characters at author discreTon. This applies to both normaTve and informaTve references.

Format Next Steps
•  For all dracs:
–  Incorporate feedback received during IETF 89 (as
appropriate)
–  Finish dracs and start the formal publicaTon process (which includes more community review) before IETF 90
•  Create a Statement of Work to write the specs and start the community review process during IETF 90
–  SpecificaTon(s) for tool(s) that create XML, HTML, PDF, and TXT documents, following the requirements and profiles defined in the dracs/RFCs produced by the RFC Format Design Team
•  Start development of tools based on well-defined specs by IETF 91
